# PhotoFlick

  PhotoFlick is Ruby gem with which you can create image collages from Flickr images. You just need to provide some search keywords and PhotoFlick will search through Flickr to get images and create collage for you. 

## Dependency

  PhotoFlick creates collages by using image processing tool [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php). So you have to install ImageMagick first. 


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'photo_flick'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install photo_flick

## Usage

  PhotoFlick will add an executable 'photoflick' to your system path. You just need to run command 'photoflick' from your terminal and follow the onscreen instructions.
